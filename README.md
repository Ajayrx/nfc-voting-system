# Ncrypt - Hardware Prototype || Google Solution Challenge

ðŸ§  This is a simulated hardware prototype for NFC-based voter verification using:
- âœ… Government-signed NFC Cards
- ðŸ”’ Fingerprint Hash Matching
- ðŸš¨ Fake Card Detection

## files - New things Added
- Arduino writer code - ino file
- voter card system 
- to write voter card using a tkinter based gui connected to Arduino 

## Files - old
- `nfc_reader.py` â€“ Simulates scanning NFC cards
- `fingerprint_hash.py` â€“ Simulates fingerprint scanning
- `voter_verification.py` â€“ Core logic combining both verifications
- `test/test_verification.py` â€“ Runs multiple test cases
- `cards/fake_and_real_cards.json` â€“ Optional card database

This prototype is ready to be extended to real Raspberry Pi hardware with NFC and biometric modules.

## Still in very early phase need mentor and guidence to carry one working seems easy not not that easy.
