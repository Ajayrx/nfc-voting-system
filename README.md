# Project Ncrypt - Hardware Prototype

🧠 This is a simulated hardware prototype for NFC-based voter verification using:
- ✅ Government-signed NFC Cards
- 🔒 Fingerprint Hash Matching
- 🚨 Fake Card Detection

## Files
- `nfc_reader.py` – Simulates scanning NFC cards
- `fingerprint_hash.py` – Simulates fingerprint scanning
- `voter_verification.py` – Core logic combining both verifications
- `test/test_verification.py` – Runs multiple test cases
- `cards/fake_and_real_cards.json` – Optional card database

This prototype is ready to be extended to real Raspberry Pi hardware with NFC and biometric modules.
